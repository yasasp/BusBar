# This Code is describing a coin flip game explained on Ted Talk, where I try to implement the game in D-Wave.

# If I want to check, whether QC cheated or not, I have to go back to and check the coin state of the
# intermediate steps. To do this I have to ask QC. So, QC will 'lie" (possibly) as it will only show
# the coin states which lead to a win. Isn't this cheating ? Can anyone correct if I am wrong?
